## Summary 
Being tech-savvy I always was interested in technologies, even took some online courses and worked as system - administrator for short period of time in a small company in my country, and I really liked it, and it gaved me strong motivation to start new path. So, I researched and gived a try for graphic design and web development. Subsequently, choosed frontend and now my short term goal - is become Middle Front-End Developer during next 1-2 years, and to improve my skills even further. By now Front-End is appealing for me, and beside this, after reaching this goal I want to study Dev Ops as well. The important thing for me - I want to become really succesfull developer and to leave my mark on next generation learners with EPAM, and even more: to extend learning possibilities for less rich countries as well, for instance even my country - Kyrgyzstan. There are a lot of talented people there as myself.
